
## Usage

Install [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), the only dependency, if you need to:

```bash
$ pip install numpy
```

Then, run it with no arguments:

```bash
$ python network.py
```

You can also [run this code in your browser](https://repl.it/@vzhou842/An-Introduction-to-Neural-Networks).
